              Start by getting in touch with the judgment debtor. Give them an address where they can mail the payment. You can offer to accept less than the whole judgment if they pay right away. Or, you can agree to take regular payments.

              Write to the judgment debtor instead of calling. That way, you cannot argue. The person who owes you money can pay you or the court all at once, or ask to make payments. Both parties can also "stipulate" (agree) to a payment plan. Fill out the form Stipulation for Time Payments (L-1094)  and file it with the court after it has been signed by both parties.
              
              If you cannot agree on a payment plan, the judgment debtor can file a form called Request to Make Payments (SC-220) . The court will mail you a copy. You can file a Response to Request to Make Payments (SC-221)  that lets the court know what kind of payment plan you want. Read the Payments In Small Claims (SC-220-INFO)  for more information.
